DB helpers to complement phlib/db

## Installation

```php
composer require phlib/db-helper
```

## Usage

```php
// Get an Adapter
$config = [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'username' => 'myuser',
    'password' => 'mypassword',
    'dbname' => 'mydatabase'
];
$db = new \Phlib\Db\Adapter($config);
```

### BulkInsert

Insert and/or update many rows into a table.

This increases the write performance for adding large numbers (eg. thousands+)
of rows, over the typical pseudo-prepared statements used by native PDO.

```php
$insertFields = [
    'product_id',
    'product_name',
    'product_qty'
];
$updateFields = [
    'product_name',
    'product_qty'
];
$bulkInsert = new BulkInsert($adapter, 'product', $insertFields, $updateFields);

// Many calls to add() will write to the DB in batches
$bulkInsert->add($singleProductData);

// One final manual call to write() to complete
$bulkInsert->write();
```

### QueryPlanner

Test the number of rows that a `SELECT` statement will query.

```php
$queryPlanner = new QueryPlanner($adapter, $sqlSelect);
$queryPlanner->getNumberOfRowsInspected(); // eg. 46234
```

### BigResult

Run a `SELECT` statement which is expected to be slow (eg. >5s) due to quantity
of data.

Query buffering is disabled to reduce the time to first row and avoid consuming
PHP's memory for the statement result, and MySQL's query timeout is increased.

```php
$bigResult = new BigResult($adapter);
$pdoStmt = $bigResult->query($sqlSelect, $bind);
```

Optionally, prevent very large queries from running by using the QueryPlanner
inspection:

```php
$bigResult = new BigResult($adapter);
$queryRowLimit = 20000000;
$pdoStmt = $bigResult->query($sqlSelect, $bind, $queryRowLimit);
```
